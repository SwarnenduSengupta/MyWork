##Codebook

After a review of the various code books available for the class, I decided to use the Gapminder data set.

##Question

Is there an association between Internet usage and suicide rates?  I will use the variables Internetuserate and suicideper100TH rate in my code book.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load functions
source('C:/Users/bryan_000/Documents/GitHub/MyWork/functions.R')
library(reshape2)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2) 
library(dplyr)
library(corrgram)
df<-read.csv("D:/Data/EdX/gapminder.csv")
```

##Literature Review

There is concern that the Internet is playing an increasing role in self-harm and suicide. Internet use may exert both positive and negative effects on young people at risk of self-harm or suicide. The internet has created channels of communication that can be misused to 'cyber-bully' peers; both cyber-bullying and general internet use have been found to correlate with increased risk of self-harm, suicidal idealization, and depression.  Youth who self-harm or are suicidal often make use of the internet. It is most commonly used for constructive reasons such as seeking support and coping strategies, but may exert a negative influence, normalizing self-harm and potentially discouraging disclosure or professional help-seeking. Correlations have been found between internet exposure and violent methods of self-harm.

##Hypothesis

There is a positive relationship between Internet usage rates and suicide rates.

##Summary of All Variables

Below are variable names and summaries of all the variables in the data set
```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(df)
summary(df)
```


##Data Analysis

###Countries by Internet Use Rates

Top users
```{r, echo=FALSE}
chart <- df %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise(Max = max(internetuserate))
top40 <- chart %>% arrange(desc(Max)) %>% top_n(40)
top40
```

Bottom users
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bottom40 <- chart %>% arrange(desc(Max)) %>% tail(40)
bottom40
```

###Countries by Suicide Rates

Top suicide rates
```{r, echo=FALSE}
chart2 <- df %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise(Max = max(suicideper100th))
top40 <- chart2 %>% arrange(desc(Max)) %>% top_n(40)
top40
```

Bottom suicide rates
```{r, echo=FALSE}
bottom40 <- chart2 %>% arrange(desc(Max)) %>% tail(40)
bottom40
```

###Frequency Distributions
```{r,echo=FALSE}
rates = !is.na(df$internetuserate)
rates2 = df$internetuserate[rates]
breaks2 = seq(0, 100, by=10)
rates = !is.na(df$suicideper100th)
rates3 =df$suicideper100th[rates]
breaks3 = seq(0, 40, by=5)

rates2.cut = cut(rates2, breaks2, right=FALSE)
rates3.cut = cut(rates3, breaks3, right=FALSE)

rates2.freq = table(rates2.cut)
rates3.freq = table(rates3.cut)
```

Internet Usage Rates (N/A's removed)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cbind(rates2.freq)
```

Suicide Rates (N/A's removed)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cbind(rates3.freq)
```

###Visual Displays
```{r, echo=FALSE}
colors = c("red", "yellow", "green", "violet", "orange", "blue", "pink", "cyan") 
hist(rates2,main="Internet Usage Histogram",xlab="Internet Usage Rate", col=colors)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(rates3,,main="Suicide Rates Histogram",xlab="Suicide Rate per 100", col=colors)
```

###Assocaition

Regression Model
```{r,echo=FALSE}
model=lm(df$suicideper100th~df$internetuserate)
summary(model)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(df$internetuserate,df$suicideper100th,main="Scatterplot", xlab="Internet Usage Rate ", ylab="Suicide Rates per 100 ", pch=19)
```


##Conclusion
There is a weak positive correlation between Internet usage rates and suicide rates.
