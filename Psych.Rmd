This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

Need to install psych package for these:

#alpha.scale     #find coefficient alpha for a scale and a dataframe of items
#describe        give means, sd, skew, n, and se 
#summ.stats      #basic summary statistics by a grouping variable
#error.crosses   #(error bars in two space)
#skew            find skew
#panel.cor       taken from the examples for pairs
#pairs.panels    adapted from panel.cor  --   gives a splom, histogram, and correlation matrix
#multi.hist     #plot multiple histograms
#correct.cor    #given a correlation matrix and a vector of reliabilities, correct for reliability
#fisherz        #convert pearson r to fisher z
#paired.r       #test for difference of dependent correlations
#count.pairwise  #count the number of good cases when doing pairwise analysis
#eigen.loadings  #convert eigen vector vectors to factor loadings by unnormalizing them
#principal       #yet another way to do a principal components analysis -- brute force eignvalue decomp 
#factor.congruence #find the factor congruence coeffiecints
#factor.model    #given a factor model, find the correlation matrix
#factor.residuals #how well does it fit?
#factor.rotate    # rotate two columns of a factor matrix by theta (in degrees)
#phi2poly       #convert a matrix of phi coefficients to polychoric correlations
