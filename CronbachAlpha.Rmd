This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
##Use my standard openning including call function
source('C:/Users/bryan_000/Documents/GitHub/MyWork/StdOpen.R')

call("psych")

QUEST <- data.frame(
        Q1=c(1,5,2,3,4,2,3,4,3,2), 
        Q2=c(2,4,1,2,4,1,2,5,2,1), 
        Q3=c(2,5,1,3,3,2,2,4,2,2))

alpha(QUEST)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
