Generate some random data
```{r}
mydata = matrix(rbinom(10*1000, 1, .5), ncol=10)
mydata
```

Write the data to a csv file
```{r}
# Write CSV in R
write.csv(mydata, file = "MyData.csv")
```

To omit the row names, add a comma and then row.names=FALSE. 
```{r}
# Write CSV in R
write.csv(mydata, file = "MyDataNoRowName.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```

To omit NAs, add a comma and then na="".
```{r}
# Write CSV in R
write.csv(mydata, file = "MyDataNoRowNameNoNA.csv",row.names=FALSE, na="")
```

To save as an R file.
```{r}
# Write R
save(mydata, file = "MyData.Rdata")
```
