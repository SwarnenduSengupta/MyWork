##Simpson Paradox
In probability and statistics, Simpson's paradox (Yule-Simpson effect) is an apparent paradox in which a trend present in different groups is reversed when the groups are combined. 

This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics.  Simpson's Paradox disappears when causal relations are brought into consideration.  

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
##Use my standard openning including call function
source('C:/Users/bryan_000/Documents/GitHub/MyWork/StdOpen.R')

call("epicalc")
call("survival")
call("graphics")

datafile <- paste(datadir,"smokerdisease.csv",sep = "")
studydata<- read.csv(datafile)
```

Create a table of the data
```{r createit, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
df <- ftable(table(studydata$smoker, studydata$disease,studydata$female))
##Nonsmokers - Nondisease
df[1,1] #Male Nonsmokers Nondisease
df[1,2] #Female Nonsmokers Nondisease

##Nonsmokers - disease
df[2,1] #Male Nonsmokers Disease
df[2,2] #Female Nonsmokers Disease

##Smokers - Nondisease
df[3,1] #Male Smokers Nondisease
df[3,2] #Female Smokers Nondisease

##Smokers - Disease
df[4,1] #Male Smokers Disease
df[4,2] #Female Smokers Disease
```

Raw results
```{r raw, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
##OVerall results no breakdown for Sex
##csi(exposed-positive,exposed-negative,nonexposed-positive,nonexposed-negative)
## Risk Ratio = .93
## Risk difference = -.02
csi(df[4,1]+df[4,2],df[3,1]+df[3,2],df[2,1]+df[2,2],df[1,1]+df[1,2])

## OR = .91
cci(df[4,1]+df[4,2],df[3,1]+df[3,2],df[2,1]+df[2,2],df[1,1]+df[1,2])
```

Interpret the estimate risk difference:  2% fewer people in the smoker group got the disease (as compared to the non smoking group).


Results for males only:
```{r male,warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
##results for males only
## Risk Ratio = 1.81
## Risk difference = .08
csi(df[4,1],df[3,1],df[2,1],df[1,1])

## OR = 1.99
cci(df[4,1],df[3,1],df[2,1],df[1,1])
```

Interpret the estimate risk difference:  8% more males in the smoker group got the disease (as compared to the non smoking group).


Results for only the females
```{r female, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
##results for females only
## Risk Ratio = 1.53
## Risk difference = .16
csi(df[4,2],df[3,2],df[2,2],df[1,2])

## OR = 1.99
cci(df[4,2],df[3,2],df[2,2],df[1,2])
```

Interpret the estimate risk difference:  16% more females in the smoker group got the disease (as compared to the non smoking group).
