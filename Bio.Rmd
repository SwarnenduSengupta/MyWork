##Testing for an Association Between Disease and Exposure (Cohort or Case-Control Study)
In a case-control or cohort study, it is interesting to do a statistical test for association between having the disease and being exposed to some treatment or environment (for example, smoking or taking a certain drug).

In R, you can test for an association using the Chi-squared test, or Fisher's exact test. 
```{r,,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
chisq.test(mymatrix, correct = FALSE)

fisher.test(mymatrix)
```
